Application-specific source code, notebooks, libraries, and models have been moved to this [repo](https://github.com/fluxcapacitor/source.ml).

These repos are stitched together at deployment time using Kubernetes Volumes - similar to Docker Volumes.

## Deploying Models
Details documentation and a command-line utility are coming very soon.

In the meantime, checkout this [notebook](https://github.com/fluxcapacitor/source.ml/blob/master/jupyterhub.ml/notebooks/talks/GlobalDataScience/Mar272017-SantaClara-Deploy-SparkML-TensorflowAI/GlobalDataScience-SparkMLTensorflowAI-HybridCloud-ContinuousDeployment.ipynb) and others in that project.
