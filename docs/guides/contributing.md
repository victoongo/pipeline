Interested in helping us out?  We are looking for help to port popular and useful machine learning and artificial intelligence models and runtimes into PipelineIO.

The active list of outstanding PipelineIO issues and features are [here](https://github.com/fluxcapacitor/pipeline/issues).

## What you need to do
- Create a GitHub issue.
- Run the project on PipelineIO (Training and/or Evaluation). 
- Make sure the GitHub issue has instructions on how to replicate your work.
- Email us links to the GitHub issue and your code.

## Miscellaneous
- The project should be open source under a liberal license (ie. Apache2, MIT)
- The project should use publicly-available training and validation data.
